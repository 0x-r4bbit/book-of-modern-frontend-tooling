## Status

This book is in the early phases of planning. The idea is to capture enough useful content on each topic that a beginner could get started with a specific tool in a short space of time.

We will aim to present all tools in a balanced light, providing the user with enough information to make up their minds on what makes sense for them to use. The book will be kept up to date by the authors and pull requests from the community will be happily accepted as with any OSS project.

## Getting involved

We are currently looking for authors who:

* Have previously written detailed posts about one of the suggested topics that could be refreshed and integrated
* Authors interested in contributing new content on one of the topics above

New issues will be created for each corresponding section so commenting on the appropriate thread would be the best way to let us know you're interested.
